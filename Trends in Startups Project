#Here I showcase my ability to use aggregate functions in SQL to extract meaningful information from a database
that includes information about different startups. The purpose of the project is to find out what trends are found in the different companies.

-- What is the total number of companies? 

SELECT COUNT(name) AS 'Total Companies'
FROM startups;

-- What is the total value of all companies?

SELECT SUM(valuation) AS 'Total Value'
FROM startups;

-- What is the highest amount raised by a startup?

SELECT MAX(raised) AS 'Highest Amount Raised'
FROM startups;

-- What is the highest amount raised by a startup during seed stage?

SELECT MAX(raised) 
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';

-- When was the oldest company founded?

SELECT MIN(founded) AS 'Oldest Company'
FROM startups;

-- What is the average value of the companies?

SELECT AVG(valuation) AS 'Average Value'
FROM startups;



EVALUATION AMONG DIFFERENT SECTORS:

-- Average value of each category.

SELECT category, AVG(valuation) 
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

-- Average value of each category rounded to two decimals.

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) 
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

-- Average value of each category rounded to two decimals ordered from highest to lowest.

SELECT category, ROUND(AVG(valuation), 2) 
FROM startups
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


WHAT ARE THE MOST COMPETITIVE MARKETS?

#First:

-- What is the total number of companies that belong to each category?

SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_companies_category
FROM startups
GROUP by category;

#Second:

-- Let's filter the previous query so that it only returns those categories with MORE than three companies.

SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_companies_category
FROM startups
GROUP by category
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STARTUPS' SIZES AMONG DIFFERENT LOCATIONS.

#First:

-- What is the average size of a startup in each location?

SELECT location, AVG(employees) AS 'Average Size'
FROM startups
GROUP BY location;

#Second:

-- What is the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500?

SELECT location, AVG(employees) 
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING AVG(employees) > 500
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

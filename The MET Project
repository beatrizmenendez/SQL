#In this project, I'm querying a database that's holding data from The Metropolitan Museum of Art to answer questions about the data. 



#1. How many pieces are in the American Decorative Art collection?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM met;

#2. Celery was considered a luxurious snack in the Victorian era (around the 1800s). Thus, count the number of art pieces
where the category included celery.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';

#2.5. Let's find out the category names.

SELECT DISTINCT category
FROM met
WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';

#3. What is the title and medium of the oldest art piece in the MET?

-- First, let's find out the lowest year.

SELECT MIN(date)
FROM met;

-- Second, let's find the pieces made between 1600-1700 (results from previous query).

SELECT date, title, medium
FROM met
WHERE date LIKE %1600%;

#4. Let's find the 10 top countries with the most art pieces in the MET.

SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- To avoid NULL values, let's precise the specify the query.

SELECT country, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;

#5. Find the categories with more than 100 pieces.

SELECT category, COUNT(*)
FROM met
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;

#6. Count the number of pieces where the medium contains ‘gold’ or ‘silver'. Order it by descending order.

SELECT medium, COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE medium LIKE '%gold%'
   OR medium LIKE '%silver%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- UB the result, there are ‘Silver’, ‘Gold’, but also a lot of other mediums with these two words. Let's be more accurate.

SELECT CASE
   WHEN medium LIKE '%gold%' THEN 'Gold'
   WHEN medium LIKE '%silver%' THEN 'Silver'
   ELSE NULL
  END AS 'Bling',
  COUNT(*)
FROM met
WHERE Bling IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
